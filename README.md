## Usage

`MessagePipeline<I, O>`: An interface for transforming `I`'s into `O`'s, according to a `PipelineContext` object. They 
can be created using the `MessagePipeline.Builder<I, O>` class. For example:
```java
MessagePipeline<Object, String> toStringPipeline = 
        MessagePipeline.<String>builder()
                .add((i, ctx) -> Objects.toString(i))
                .build();

int i = 10;
String o = toStringPipeline.accept(i); // Will become "10"
```
This example pipeline converts any object given to it into a String by calling toString on it. This pipeline is simple,
but much more complicated pipelines can be created.

`PipelineContext`: Simply contains a list of objects. These can be accessed by index or by class. For example:
```java
PipelineContext ctx = PipelineContext.of(new Player("Steve"));
Optional<Player> pl = ctx.getFirst(Player.class);
```
<br/>

`UnresolvedMessage<T>`: An object which contains a list of objects that are either `T` or a `PlaceholderInstance<T, P>`.

`PlaceholderInstance<T, P>`: An instance of a `Placeholder<T, P>` (see below.) Contains a reference to the `Placeholder<T, P>`,
and a (nullable) parameter of type `P`

`Placeholder<T,P>`: Represents a placeholder which resolves to a `T`. Contains a name, some logic (`PlaceholderSupplier<T, P>`) 
to resolve an instance of itself according to a `ResolveContext<P>` object, and some logic (`ParameterTransformer<P>`) 
to convert a parsed text parameter into a `P` (if necessary.)

A simple placeholder (without a parameter) can be created as follows:
```java
Placeholder<String, Void> simple = Placeholder.of("name", String.class, ctx -> Optional.of("Steve")); 
```
This example placeholder is named "name" and will always resolve to "Steve"

As mentioned above placeholders can also have parameters. Parameters are always parsed as type `UnresolvedMessage<String>`.
Each placeholder needs to provide some logic to convert that parameter to its `P` type, at parse-time. There are two 
included transformers:
- `ParameterTransformer.IDENTITY`: Keeps the parameter unchanged. (`P` in this case must be `UnresolvedMessage<String>`)
- `ParameterTransformer.RESOLVE_EARLY`: Resolves the parameter's placeholders with an empty `ResolveContext<P>` object.
  (`P` in this case must be `String`)

A parametrized placeholder could be defined as follows:
```java
Placeholder<String, String> toUpper = Placeholder.of(
        "to_upper", 
        String.class, 
        ctx -> Optional.of(ctx.param().toUpperCase()), 
        ParameterTransformer.RESOLVE_EARLY);
```
This example placeholder will simply return its parameter, converted to upper case. Note that since `ParameterTransformer.RESOLVE_EARLY`
was used here, any nested placeholders within the parameter itself will not be resolved according to the right context.
In most cases, it will be more desirable to use `ParameterTransformer.IDENTITY` along with `UnresolvedMessage.resolve(ctx.param(), ctx.context())`
at resolve-time.

`PlaceholderManager`: Holds a mapping from strings to `Placeholder<?,?>` objects. An instance can be created using the
default constructor, and registering a placeholder is as simple as calling `register(Placeholder<?,?>)` on it.

`PlaceholderParser`: A pipeline stage for parsing placeholders from strings, according to a given `PlaceholderManager`.
One could be integrated into a pipeline as follows:
```java
PlaceholderManager manager;
Pipeline<String, UnresolvedMessage<String>> pipeline = 
        MessagePipeline.<String>builder()
                .add(new PlaceholderParser(manager))
                .build();
```

### Placeholder string format
- Parameterless placeholders are formatted as such: `<name>`
- Parametrized placeholders are formatted as such: `<to_upper>param</to_upper>`
    - Note: If a placeholder accepts a parameter, one *must* be specified.
- Parametrized placeholders can have placeholders within the parameter: `<to_upper><name></to_upper>`


`PlaceholderResolver<T>`: A pipeline stage for resolving placeholders of type `T`. It both accepts and returns an object
of type `UnresolvedMessage<T>`. However, all the placeholders of type `Placeholder<T, ?>` will be resolved in the output.

`PlaceholderStripper<T>`: A pipeline stage which removes all unresolved placeholders from the input. It accepts an
`UnresolvedMessage<T>` and returns a `List<T>`

`MessageJoiner<T>`: A pipeline stage for joining resolved message parts together. It accepts a `List<T>` and returns a `T`.
This is only an interface and needs to be implemented for each message type you use. There is a default implementation for
`String` at `MessageJoiner.STRING`


### Putting it All Together
Using all the tools listed above, you can create a pipeline which parses, resolves, strips and joins messages. One for
Strings would look something like the following:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    PlaceholderManager manager = new PlaceholderManager();
    manager.register(Placeholder.of("name", String.class, ctx -> ctx.getFirst(Player.class).map(Player::name)));
    manager.register(Placeholder.of(
          "to_upper",
          String.class,
          ctx -> Optional.of(UnresolvedMessage.resolve(ctx.param(), ctx.context()).toUpperCase()),
          ParameterTransformer.IDENTITY));

    MessagePipeline<String, String> pipeline = 
            MessagePipeline.<String>builder()
                    .add(new PlaceholderParser(manager))
                    .add(new PlaceholderResolver<>(String.class))
                    .add(new PlaceholderStripper<>())
                    .add(MessageJoiner.STRING)
                    .build();
    
    System.out.println(pipeline.accept("Hello, <to_upper><name></to_upper>", PipelineContext.of(new Player("Steve")))); // This will print "Hello, STEVE"
}
```


### Context Placeholders
The `PipelineContext` class contains a `contextPlaceholders` field. The placeholder resolver will look in there if no
placeholder with that name could be found at parse-time.

## Language Module

Along with `pseudonym-api`, another module is published: `pseudonym-lang`. This module is meant for managing message
translations.

`LangRegistry<P>`: A record which contains a map from String keys to a parsed type `P`

`LangProvider<P>`: An interface for loading `LangRegistry<P>`'s from some source. By default, one is provided: 
`LangProvider.Directory`, which loads language files from a directory using [MidnightConfig](https://github.com/wallenjos01/midnightconfig).

`LangManager<P, R>`: Contains a map from String keys to `LangRegistry<P>`'s, and a pipeline for resolving messages. It 
also contains a few utility functions for getting messages for specific languages, resolved according to a `PipelineContext`


Example:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

    PlaceholderManager manager = new PlaceholderManager();
    manager.register(Placeholder.of("name", String.class, ctx -> ctx.getFirst(Player.class).map(Player::name)));
    manager.register(Placeholder.of(
            "to_upper",
            String.class,
            ctx -> Optional.of(UnresolvedMessage.resolve(ctx.param(), ctx.context()).toUpperCase()),
            ParameterTransformer.IDENTITY));
    
    FileCodecRegistry codecs = new FileCodecRegistry();
    codecs.register(JSONCodec.fileCodec()); // Requires org.wallentines:midnightcfg-codec-json

    MessagePipeline<String, UnresolvedMessage<String>> parser =
          MessagePipeline.<String>builder()
                  .add(new PlaceholderParser(manager))
                  .build();

    // Assume two files:
    // - en.json
    //   { "greeting": "Hello, <name>" }
    // - es.json
    //   { "greeting": "Hola, <name>" }
    LangProvider<UnresolvedMessage<String>> provider = LangProvider.forDirectory(Paths.get("lang"), codecs, parser);
    
    MessagePipeline<UnresolvedMessage<String>, String> resolver =
          MessagePipeline.<String>builder()
                  .add(new PlaceholderResolver<>(String.class))
                  .add(new PlaceholderStripper<>())
                  .add(MessageJoiner.STRING)
                  .build();
    
    LangManager<UnresolvedMessage<String>, String> lang = new LangManager<>(
            String.class, 
            LangRegistry.empty(),
            provider,
            resolver);
    
    PipelineContext ctx = PipelineContext.of(new Player("Steve"));
    
    String greetingEn = lang.getMessage("greeting", "en", ctx); // Will be "Hello, Steve"
    String greetingEs = lang.getMessage("greeting", "es", ctx); // Will be "Hola, Steve"
}
```


## Usage with Minecraft

This project also contains two other modules: `pseudonym-minecraft` and `pseudonym-text`. 
- `pseudonum-minecraft` contains tools for applying placeholders to Minecraft's `Component` classes. It is packaged as a 
  [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod. It also contains parsers for so-called "legacy text" (ex. `ยง6Hello`), and "config text"
  (ex. `&#123ABCHello`). It contains a resolution pipeline specifically tailored to work with this config text.
- `pseudonym-text` contains a reimplementation of Minecraft's text component system, and is designed for use in
  projects which need to be compatible with Minecraft text, but do not have Minecraft's classes accessible at runtime.
  It contains many of the same tools as `pseudonym-minecraft`. These two modules should not be used at the same time.

Example:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

    PlaceholderManager manager = new PlaceholderManager();
    manager.register(Placeholder.of("player_name", Component.class, ctx -> ctx.getFirst(Player.class).map(Player::getDisplayName)));

    MessagePipeline<String, Component> pipeline =
            MessagePipeline.<String>builder()
                    .add(new PlaceholderParser())
                    .add(TextUtil.COMPONENT_RESOLVER)
                    .build();
    
    Component out = pipeline.accept("&6Hello, <player_name>"); // Will become {"text":"Hello, ","color":"gold","extra":[{"text":"Steve",...}]}
    
}
```
